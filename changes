1) there is problem with the shorting in seeds and peers so change the first shorting according to the max seeds and peers to low seeds and peers

2) if magnet link is not there then remove that data from the response 

3) there is some response not showing the resolution, set them

4) if i will pass the data with the language perameter then you have to merge two data one is with language perameter with gives a movie in specific language and another is without laguage peram.
example:- (0.0.0.0:3000/Movies?Search=Tenet&Year=2020&Language=Hindi  +   0.0.0.0:3000/Movies?Search=Tenet&Year=2020)


5) there is problem in season and episode. when i find the specific episode of specific season then now it provides me the diffrent data so change the reposnse so i get the accurate results. in this i want you to merge two responses (0.0.0.0:3000/Movies?Search=breaking%20bad&Season=01&Episode=01&Language=Hindi     +    0.0.0.0:3000/Movies?Search=breaking%20bad&Season=01&Episode=01   +      0.0.0.0:3000/Movies?Search=breaking%20bad&Season=01) 

6) Remove all the results which has less then 10 seeds and peers.
